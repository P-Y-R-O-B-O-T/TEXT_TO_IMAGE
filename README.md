# TEXT_TO_IMAGE

![](ZZZ/ZZZ.png)

* Ever tried to look cool ?

* Want to create an image file using an input source ?

* Here are 2 types of converters, one is that keeps the dimentions of the source and one converts the dimention of the source to an square matrix.

## USAGE
* `python3 src_to_image1.py <path_to_inp_file> -n > <outfile_path>.ppm`

* `python3 src_to_image1.py <path_to_inp_file> -b > <outfile_path>.ppm`

* `python3 src_to_image2.py <path_to_inp_file> -n > <outfile_path>.ppm`

* `python3 src_to_image2.py <path_to_inp_file> -b > <outfile_path>.ppm`
